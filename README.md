# Number-guessing-game
A simple number guessing game made by using python. My first ever python project!
# How it works
- The game chooses a secret number within the given range
- The player enters a number
- If the number is equal to the secret number the player wins
- If not the player can try again
# Features 
- The game loops until the player guesses the correct number
- The number is chosen at random so no repititions
# Future updates
Haven't thought about them yet but maybe I'll add difficulty levels once I get good at python
